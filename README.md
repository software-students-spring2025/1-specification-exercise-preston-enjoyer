## Product Vision Statement 

The NYU Gym Traffic Tracker is a user-friendly app that provides real-time gym occupancy data across NYU’s fitness facilities, allowing students and staff to plan their workouts efficiently, minimize wait times, and enhance their fitness experience.

## User Requirements 

    1. As an NYU student, I want to see the current occupancy levels of all NYU gyms so that I can choose the least crowded one

    2. As a gym-goer, I want to see a list of all gym equipment and the percentage of each being used so that I can decide whether my preferred equipment is available. 

    3. As a busy student, I want the app to recommend the best time to visit each gym so that I can plan my workout efficiently around my schedule.

    4. As an NYU resident, I want the app to calculate the distance from my current location to each gym so that I can decide which gym is the closest.

    5. As a new student on campus, I want to see each gym's hours, location, and contact information so that I can familiarize myself with all the facilities.

    6. As a student dorming very close to the gym, I want to receive notifications when a gym’s occupancy drops below a certain threshold so that I can quickly go or adjust my schedule. 

    7. As a beginner at the gym, I want to know the quieter times at each facility so that I can feel more comfortable and confident while learning to use the equipments.

    8. As a powerlifter at NYU, I want to know the availability of squat racks and platforms so that I can schedule my training sessions without long delays.

    9. As a runner, I want to know if there are any treadmills available so I don't have to wait. 

    10. As a commuter, I want to be able to see if each of the gyms are open.
